## Create ssh tunnel from your AWS image to your local computer
---
1. Connect your aws instance from your local machine with the following command<br />
```ssh -i your-regional.pem ec2-user@YOUR-PUBLIC-IP.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com ```
2. After successfully connecting your aws instance run the following command
```jupyter notebook```
3. Type ```q``` and ```yes``` in the jupyter notebook help screen
4. After that, you need to see a message like the following:
```bash
[I 10:59:34.434 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/ec2-user
[I 10:59:34.434 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 10:59:34.434 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 10:59:34.434 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=64eff78dc00bb6cc8be97e0265425771d9f43fd6e6fb178a
[I 10:59:34.434 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 10:59:34.435 NotebookApp]

    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=64eff78dc00bb6cc8be97e0265425771d9f43fd6e6fb178a
```

**Now, you need to listen your aws instance on your local computer via ssh.**

5. Open new terminal window on your local machine and type the following command:
```ssh -i your-regional.pem -f ec2-user@ec2-18-219-165-128.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com -L 8888:localhost:8888 -N ```
Note: This command your aws instance's port 8888 to your local machine's 8888
6. Open up your favorite browser and paste the adress given by ipython notebook (e.g. see 5) Done!


#### Troubleshooting
1. At step 5 you may get an error like:
```bash
bind: Address already in use
channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 8888
Could not request local forwarding.
```
That means your local machine's port is listened by some other process. In this case you may have look at the process via
```	ps -x | grep ssh # on Mac-Os``` or ```ps -aux | grep ssh # on Linux``` see something similar to the following:

```bash
1556 ??   0:00.11 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l
12856 ??  0:00.03 ssh -i your-regional.pem -f ec2-user@ec2-18-219-165-128.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com -L 8888:localhost:8888 -N
10060 ttys000    0:00.64 ssh lnode
12921 ttys004    0:00.00 grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn ssh
```
At this point you have 2 options either kill the ssh process or listen from another port:
To kill ```kill process-ID``` or 
to map another port (e.g.8889) ```ssh -i your-regional.pem -f ec2-user@ec2-18-219-165-128.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com -L 8889:localhost:8888 -N ```

2. Please make sure you give the correct path of your .pem file with ```-i``` flag
