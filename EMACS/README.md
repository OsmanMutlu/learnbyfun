 # Personal Emacs  Notes
 ---
Please notice that the configuration file, which is not served for my daily usage, is pretty immature and designed to learn emacs from scratch. I would recommended that directory to use as a notebook. I think [Ilker](https://github.com/ilkerkesen)'s [repo](https://github.com/ilkerkesen) is concrete for daily usage.
