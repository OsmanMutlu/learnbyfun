# To introduce julia macro expansions
# You may find more useful information from:

  https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/metaprogramming/

Suppose you are going to write a macro such that it will take its arguments, then apply the function itself to the arguments
and finally sum the results:

```julia
	macro mysum(f, x...)
	   return Expr(:sum, Expr(:call, $f, $x...))
	end	  
```
TODO:
1. Better understand Expressions, take a look julia's official examples.
2. Learn to distinguish make_expr vs. macro implementations (under the hood)
